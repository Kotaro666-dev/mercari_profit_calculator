# mercari_profit_calculator

This is my very first Flutter App. This idea was inspired by my wife, who loves Mercari:
one of the most famous Flea market apps in Japan.

It's super simple app:

1. You can check your profit report by total, month and today on Main Page
2. You click 'add' icon and type item name, sold price and shipping fee.
3. You click ADD and then your new profit data is sent to the database.
4. You can check your profit history so far in the order of latest dates.

This app is connected with Google Cloud Database. Therefore, you can always get latest update from database within a second.
